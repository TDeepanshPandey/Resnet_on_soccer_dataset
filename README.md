# ResNet trained on Soccer Dataset

In this project we have collected data from different videos of football playing robots in robocup. The images are collected at 2 frame per second from videos and then we used a pretrained ResNet model for classification of these images into three different types of robots - Copedo, Dynaped and Igus. 

**Following is a sample image of Igus -**

We are able to get validation accuracy of 97%.
