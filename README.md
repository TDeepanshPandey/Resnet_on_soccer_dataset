# ResNet trained on Soccer Dataset

In this project we have collected data from different videos of football playing robots in robocup. The images are collected at 2 frame per second and then we used a pretrained ResNet model for classification of these images into three different types of robots. We are able to get best validation accuracy of 97%.
